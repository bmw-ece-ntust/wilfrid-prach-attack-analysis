## 1. Smart PRACH Jamming: A Serious Threat for 5G Campus Networks

- **Problem:**
    - PRACH jammer in industrial environment can cause large-scale failure, such as an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) failing to move between factory zones
- **Importance:**
    - Traditional broadband jamming consumes high power and affects the entire network, but smart jamming is highly targeted, energy-efficient, and harder to detect
- **Challenge:**
    - No research has practical implementation of PRACH jammer
- **Contribution:**
    - Modeling of Smart Jamming Attack (Ratio of success preamble, etc) and Implementation of a Smart PRACH Jammer in OAI
